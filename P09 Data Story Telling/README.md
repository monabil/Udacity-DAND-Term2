This project aims to present the explanatory data visualization steps and to communicate the findings and patterns on the performance of baseball players. The analysis is done using
Tableau and a data set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.
There are two versions (intial and final) represented by two stories and explained in more details in the project report.

I have used different visualization techniques to communicate insights on baseball data. I have analyzed the relationships between variables, such as: handedness,
batting average, height, weight and home runs.
