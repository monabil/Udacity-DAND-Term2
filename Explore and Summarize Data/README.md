This report explores and analyzes a data set containing 1,599 red wines with 11 input attributes on the chemical proporties of the wine and 1 output attributes which is quality. In the first section I will explore the charactersistics of each attribute through univariate analysis. Then, through bivariate exploration, I will study the relation between each of the 11 indvidual attributes and the wine quality to understand which input attribute contributes more to the quality of the wine and whether some input attributes can have correlations with each others. On the last step before concluding the summary of my analysis, I will examine the interaction between 3 different attributes, consisting of 2 inputs vs. the quality through multivariate analysis.
